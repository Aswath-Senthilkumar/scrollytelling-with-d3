            <h3>From Burger Shacks to Ubiquitous Chains</h3>
            <p>Fast food restaurants now blanket the United States, as this map of outlets per 1000 people by county in 2012 shows. Each shaded square represents a county, with deeper reds highlighting areas where fast food density is highest—sometimes exceeding <span class="stat">one restaurant for every 1000 residents</span>. Hover over any county to see its exact restaurant density and compare regions across the country.</p>
            <p>The American fast food industry has evolved from small roadside stands to a massive network of over <span class="stat">200,000 establishments</span> nationwide. This transformation has fundamentally changed how Americans eat, with the average American spending $1,200 annually on fast food—roughly $70 billion nationwide.</p>
            <p class="note">Notice how the density varies dramatically by region, with some counties having 3-4 times the number of restaurants per capita compared to others.</p>

            <h3>Nationwide Penetration</h3>
            <p>Tourist hotspots and urban centers stand out, but even rural America is dotted with golden arches and neon signs. What started as local burger shacks and stands in the 1920s has exploded into a nationwide network, making fast food a fixture in daily American life.</p>
            <p>The highest density areas often correlate with interstate highways, commercial zones, and tourist destinations. Orlando, Florida, with its theme parks and transient population, boasts one of the highest ratios in the country—approximately <span class="stat">1.5 restaurants per 1000 residents</span>.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, many rural counties maintain surprisingly high densities due to highway traffic and the decline of local dining options. Fast food chains have become essential community fixtures in many small towns where they serve not just as meal options but as social gathering spots.</p>

            <h3>Growth and Distribution</h3>
            <p>Fast food density by county, 2012: Deep reds reveal where quick eats are most concentrated, from big cities to roadside stops. The map makes it clear that fast food is everywhere. But how did we get here over time?</p>
            <p>In 1970, there were approximately <span class="stat">30,000 fast food restaurants</span> in America. By 2012, that number had grown to over <span class="stat">200,000</span>—a staggering 566% increase, far outpacing population growth during the same period.</p>
            <p>This growth wasn't uniform across all chains. McDonald's led the way with over 14,000 U.S. locations, followed by Subway with nearly 26,000. Regional variation is significant too: the South has 55% more fast food restaurants per capita than the Northeast.</p>

            <h3>Supersized Growth: Fast Food's Boom</h3>
            <p>Plotting the total number of fast food locations from 1990 to 2022 unveils a dramatic upward trajectory. The timeline shows steady, almost relentless growth through the late 20th century, with the number of outlets more than doubling from around <span class="stat">25,000 in 1990</span> to a peak near <span class="stat">70,000 by the mid 2010s</span>.</p>
            <p>This surge mirrors America's on-the-go lifestyle and the franchising boom that transformed local dining habits nationwide. As Americans spent more time commuting and less time cooking, fast food filled a growing need for convenient, affordable meals.</p>

            <h3>The Franchise Revolution</h3>
            <p>The explosive growth coincided with the golden era of franchising for giants like McDonald's, Burger King, and KFC. These chains perfected the franchise model, allowing rapid expansion through local owners operating under strict brand guidelines.</p>
            <p>Suburban development and interstate highways created ideal conditions for drive-thru locations, with many chains building smaller, more efficient restaurant designs to maximize their geographic coverage. By the early 2000s, the American landscape was transformed by illuminated signs and familiar logos at nearly every major intersection.</p>

            <h3>Saturation and Stabilization</h3>
            <p>Growth slowed and slightly declined after 2016, but the scale remains staggering, cementing fast food as an integral part of communities across America. The number of fast-food locations from 1990–2022 shows an impressive climb through the 1990s and 2000s, peaking in the mid-2010s before leveling off.</p>
            <p>Many markets reached saturation, with prime locations already claimed and consumer preferences beginning to shift toward healthier options and fast-casual alternatives. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these trends, forcing chains to invest heavily in digital ordering, delivery partnerships, and drive-thru innovations.</p>

            <h3>A Meteoric Rise in Fast Food</h3>
            <p>In the post-war 1940s, America's fast-food scene was modest, just a few scattered diners and burger joints quietly serving locals. But something shifted dramatically in the decades following WWII. By the 1970s, chains like McDonald's, Burger King, and KFC were aggressively franchising nationwide, their logos becoming familiar landmarks on highways coast-to-coast.</p>
            <p>This rapid expansion mirrored the country's newfound obsession with convenience and speed, feeding an increasingly busy lifestyle. Charting this incredible rise from the humble beginnings of the 1940s to the explosive growth of the 2020s paints a picture remarkably similar to a rocket launching skyward—unstoppable, swift, and breathtaking.</p>

            <h3>The Original Pioneers: McDonald's & KFC</h3>
            <p>In 1955, McDonald's was just a modest burger stand in San Bernardino, California. Richard and Maurice McDonald perfected fast and efficient service, but it took them nineteen years just to reach their 100th restaurant. Everything changed when Ray Kroc took control in 1961, rapidly opening 500 stores by 1963, and the <span class="stat">1,000th by 1968</span>. Expansion continued relentlessly, reaching <span class="stat">10,000 stores by 1988</span>. Today, McDonald's stands tall with over <span class="stat">40,000 locations worldwide</span>.</p>
            <p>KFC's story began earlier, in 1930, with Colonel Harland Sanders' roadside diner in Corbin, Kentucky. The Colonel's secret recipe proved irresistible, achieving its 100th restaurant milestone by the late 1950s. Just like McDonald's, 1963 marked a major growth year with over <span class="stat">500 locations opened</span>. By 1970, KFC had expanded globally, reaching <span class="stat">3,000 restaurants in 48 countries</span>. Today, KFC serves millions daily at over <span class="stat">30,000 locations worldwide</span>.</p>

            <h3>Burger King & Wendy's: The Burger Competitors</h3>
            <p>Burger King entered the scene in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, famous for flame-grilled burgers. By 1977, its distinctive flame-grilled flavor had driven the chain to over <span class="stat">2,000 locations</span>. Innovations like late-night drive-thru in the early 1980s pushed Burger King further, reaching <span class="stat">10,000 stores by 1998</span>, notably accompanied by the humorous "Left-Handed Whopper" prank. Now, Burger King proudly operates over <span class="stat">20,000 restaurants globally</span>.</p>
            <p>Wendy's, founded by Dave Thomas in 1969 in Columbus, Ohio, quickly gained popularity for its square burgers and fresh ingredients. By 1978, Wendy's proudly marked its <span class="stat">1,000th location</span>. Expansion accelerated, and by 1997, Wendy's reached <span class="stat">5,000 locations</span>. Today, over <span class="stat">7,000 Wendy's restaurants</span> continue serving square patties and Frosties globally.</p>

            <h3>Coffee & Donuts Giants</h3>
            <p>Starbucks, founded in Seattle in 1971 as a specialty coffee roaster, initially sold beans rather than beverages. Its turning point came in the 1990s: <span class="stat">500 locations by 1995</span>, international expansion by 1996, and a major milestone of <span class="stat">10,000 stores by 2005</span>. With innovative drinks like the Frappuccino and Peppermint Mocha, Starbucks now proudly serves coffee culture at nearly <span class="stat">38,000 locations globally</span>.</p>
            <p>Dunkin' Donuts started in Quincy, Massachusetts, as "Open Kettle" in 1948, and swiftly captured America's coffee-and-doughnut cravings. It celebrated <span class="stat">1,000 franchises by 1979</span>, and doubled to 2,000 by 1990. By 2011, it reached <span class="stat">10,000 global locations</span>. Today, over <span class="stat">13,200 Dunkin' stores</span> around the world energize mornings in 46 countries.</p>

            <h3>Pizza Empire Builders</h3>
            <p>Pizza Hut, founded in Wichita, Kansas, in 1958, quickly dominated the family pizza market. By 1972, Pizza Hut operated over <span class="stat">1,000 restaurants</span>. The chain kept soaring, reaching <span class="stat">10,000 stores by 1994</span>, famously becoming the U.S.'s largest retailer of basketballs through promotions. Today, Pizza Hut serves pizzas at nearly <span class="stat">19,900 locations worldwide</span>.</p>
            <p>Domino's Pizza began humbly in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in 1960. It introduced quick pizza delivery, rapidly expanding: <span class="stat">1,000 stores by 1983</span>, 5,000 by 1989, and hitting its <span class="stat">10,000th location by 2012</span>. Domino's now operates around <span class="stat">19,800 restaurants worldwide</span>, popularizing innovations like pizza tracking and "Emergency Pizza" programs.</p>
            <p>Papa John's Pizza emerged from Jeffersonville, Indiana, in 1984, growing quickly due to a dedication to quality. By 1994, it operated 500 stores; by 1996, it reached 1,000. The milestone of <span class="stat">5,000 locations came in 2017</span>, with Papa John's now operating around <span class="stat">5,400 locations</span>, maintaining its "Better Ingredients, Better Pizza" ethos globally.</p>
            <p>Little Caesars started in 1959 in Garden City, Michigan, innovating with affordable "Pizza! Pizza!" deals and the Hot-N-Ready concept. Rapid growth brought the brand to <span class="stat">1,000 stores by 1986</span>, and by 2017 it surpassed <span class="stat">5,000 locations</span>. Now, Little Caesars operates approximately <span class="stat">5,300 locations globally</span>, ranking as the third-largest pizza chain worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Fast Food Diversity: Mexican, Sandwiches & More</h3>
            <p>Taco Bell began in Downey, California, in 1962, popularizing fast Mexican-American cuisine. Its 100th location opened quickly, and the brand grew rapidly, hitting <span class="stat">2,000 locations by 1985</span>. By 2010, Taco Bell reached <span class="stat">5,000 global outlets</span>, and today, it boasts over <span class="stat">8,200 locations</span> across 32 countries.</p>

            <p>Dairy Queen began delighting families with soft-serve ice cream in Joliet, Illinois, in 1940.

            <h3>Sales Stacked Like a Burger: A Delicious Journey Through Fast Food Sales (2000–2023)</h3>
            <p>At the dawn of the millennium, America's fast-food hunger was hearty—but modest. The year 2000 burger-stack is a humble creation: thin patties, a simple layer of cheese, a sprinkle of lettuce, representing around <span class="stat">$138 billion in annual fast-food sales</span>. It's uncomplicated, straightforward, and reflective of a country slowly warming up to ever-more indulgent fast-food innovations.</p>
            <p>By 2005, the burger grows noticeably taller, stacking new ingredients like fresh tomatoes and extra cheese. Annual sales had surged past <span class="stat">$160 billion</span> as Americans embraced drive-thru lifestyles, ordering quicker meals, richer flavors, and a new wave of premium choices. The stack now features a second patty—symbolizing how restaurants fought for customers by promising bigger, juicier burgers, chicken sandwiches, and more gourmet touches.</p>
            <p>Mouse over each burger to reveal sales figures and percentage growth for that specific year, watching as the visualization transforms to highlight each period's contribution to the industry's expansion.</p>

          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>The Evolution Continues</h3>
            <p>2010 brought a critical turning point. A deep recession reshaped consumer priorities, and fast-food restaurants adapted swiftly. Though sales still reached around <span class="stat">$170 billion</span>, the burger layers thinned slightly—restaurants scaled back extravagant toppings in favor of affordable combo deals. A thicker, heartier patty symbolizes indulgent comfort food, suggesting how brands like Domino's and McDonald's leveraged value meals and promotional deals to maintain steady sales despite economic uncertainty.</p>
            <p>As America recovered economically by 2015, fast-food sales soared to new heights—about <span class="stat">$200 billion annually</span>. The burger stack reflected this resurgence vividly: multiple patties, extra cheese slices, vibrant lettuce, onion rings, and premium condiments represented widespread innovations like plant-based options, artisanal sauces, and upscale menu items designed to capture more sophisticated palates. Each new topping indicated the industry's confidence, willingness to experiment, and ability to adapt to evolving consumer tastes.</p>

            <h3>Pandemic and Recovery</h3>
            <p>Then came the unexpected upheaval of 2020. With the COVID-19 pandemic transforming dining habits overnight, our burger stack momentarily shrinks. In-person dining halted; the industry pivoted rapidly toward drive-thrus, take-outs, and third-party delivery apps. The 2020 burger stack, with sales dipping slightly to about <span class="stat">$190 billion</span>, lost a layer of onion rings—reflecting simplified menus, reduced hours, and streamlined operations. It became leaner, prioritizing convenience, safety, and affordability during uncertain times.</p>
            <p>Yet the story didn't end there. By 2023, fast-food sales not only recovered but surpassed all previous heights, skyrocketing to nearly <span class="stat">$210 billion</span>. The burger stack is now taller and more extravagant than ever—multiple juicy patties stacked high, layers of fresh ingredients like leafy greens, premium cheeses, and innovative plant-based patties signify a renewed focus on taste, sustainability, and diverse dietary preferences.</p>
            <p class="note">Over two decades, this towering visual burger reflects the fascinating journey of the fast-food industry, narrating a story of economic shifts, consumer habits, culinary trends, and relentless innovation. Each ingredient and every layer not only symbolize billions in annual revenue but also showcase the industry's adaptability and ever-deepening relationship with American diners.</p>

            <h3>The Delivery Revolution</h3>
            <p>Just a decade ago, "fast food" meant driving to a restaurant. Today, it increasingly means opening an app. Our sunburst visualization reveals this dramatic transformation, with food delivery app users expanding from <span class="stat">119 million in 2017</span> to a projected <span class="stat">311.1 million by 2024</span>—a remarkable 177% increase in just eight years.</p>
            <p>This explosive growth accelerated during the pandemic, jumping from 156.2 million users in 2019 to <span class="stat">209.1 million in 2020</span>—a 34% surge in a single year as Americans sought contactless dining options. Post-pandemic, the trend continues upward, showing delivery apps aren't just a crisis convenience but a permanent shift in how America accesses fast food.</p>

            <p>Click on any app to discover how users rate their experiences. Despite occasional complaints about fees and delivery times, most apps maintain remarkably positive ratings, with the majority of users giving 4 or 5 stars. However, rating patterns reveal interesting trends—newer users tend to rate more positively than longtime users, suggesting either improving service or changing expectations.</p>
            <p>Lower ratings (1-2 stars) frequently mention high fees, cold food, and missing items. Five-star reviews praise speed, ease of use, and responsive customer service. These ratings aren't just vanity metrics—according to industry data, a half-star improvement in ratings correlates with approximately <span class="stat">8% more orders</span> per customer annually.</p>
            <p class="note">As this visualization shows, delivery apps have fundamentally altered Americans' relationship with fast food, creating a new digital layer between consumers and restaurants that continues to reshape the industry landscape.</p>

            <p>For decades, Americans spent more money on groceries than dining out. But around 2010, something changed.</p>
            <p>The data clearly highlights this shift: by 2023, U.S. consumers spent about $1.5 trillion annually on restaurants and takeout (up 145% since 2010), compared to around $1.1 trillion on groceries (up 75%). Today, dining out accounts for approximately 58% of total food spending—the highest ever recorded (USDA).</p>
            <p>Hover over the lines to see exact spending values for each category at different points in time, and observe the crossing point where restaurant spending overtook grocery spending for the first time in American history.</p>

            <h3>The Turning Point: 2010</h3>
            <p>Before 2010, groceries and restaurant spending grew steadily but separately. However, post-2010 saw restaurant spending surge ahead, driven by economic recovery after the 2008 recession, busier lifestyles, and an expanding variety of affordable dining options.</p>
            <p>Surveys (Pew Research, USDA) indicate the main reasons Americans dine out include convenience, lack of cooking time, and increased disposable income. Moreover, technology and delivery apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash further accelerated this trend, especially among urban populations (McKinsey).</p>

            <h3>The COVID-19 Dip and Rebound</h3>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic briefly reversed this trend in 2020 as restaurant spending sharply declined (down 32.6%) and grocery spending rose (up 8%), due to lockdowns and safety concerns (BLS).</p>
            <p>Yet, by 2021, dining out bounced back dramatically, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Between 2021 and 2023, restaurant spending grew rapidly, reflecting pent-up demand and ongoing consumer preferences for convenience.</p>
            <p>Though inflation may slow spending growth, the underlying factors—urban lifestyles, busy schedules, and technological convenience—remain strong. Analysts expect dining-out trends to continue dominating America's food budgets.</p>

            <h3>State Favorites: A Patchwork of Cravings</h3>
            <p>America's fast-food landscape forms a fascinating mosaic of regional preferences. Our hexagonal map reveals which chains dominate search interest across different states, with the size of each logo reflecting its relative popularity. Hover over any state's icons to see detailed search rankings and chain information and also click on states to zoom in closer to it and press 'esc' to zoom out.</p>
            <p>While national preferences show clear patterns, individual states reveal distinct cravings and loyalties. McDonald's golden arches and Starbucks' siren appear frequently in the West, while the Southeast shows unmistakable allegiance to Chick-Fil-A's iconic chicken.</p>

Meanwhile, <span class="stat">Pizza Hut</span> maintains strong popularity in 11 states, particularly across the Midwest and Great Plains.</p>
            <p>Urban-rural divides emerge clearly: coffee culture flourishes in coastal cities while pizza chains maintain strongholds in suburban and rural America. Economic factors play a role too—with pizza chains offering value family meals that resonate in regions with lower median incomes.</p>

            <h3>A Two-Decade Boom</h3>
            <p>Over the last two decades, fast-food restaurants have become a cornerstone of American employment. From bustling cities to quiet suburbs, quick meals translate to steady jobs. By late 2023, the U.S. restaurant industry—including fast-food giants—employed around <strong>12.4 million people</strong>, surpassing pre-pandemic highs (National Restaurant Association).</p>
            <p>Just glance at our visualizations: states like Texas have nearly doubled their fast-food workforce since 2001, highlighting the industry's remarkable nationwide growth.</p>

            <h3>Chefs are Rare, but Workers Abound</h3>
            <p>If you think fast food and picture chefs, think again. The charts vividly highlight a sea of red, representing "Other Workers"—cashiers, servers, food prep crews—far outnumbering professional chefs or head cooks.</p>
            <p>According to the <strong>Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</strong>, there are approximately <strong>3.3 million</strong> frontline fast-food employees nationwide compared to only a fraction of chefs. That thin yellow line you see in our charts underscores how rare chefs are in this workforce compared to everyday team members.</p>

            <h3>Not All States Grew Alike</h3>
            <p>Employment growth in fast food isn't evenly distributed across the map. Highly populated states like California, Texas, and Florida experienced sharp employment rises. Smaller or slower-growing states such as Louisiana saw relatively modest increases.</p>
            <p>This variation underscores how local economies and population shifts drive fast-food hiring. Notice how Florida's line spikes dramatically, while smaller states barely nudge upwards. It's a tale of two trends, driven by where people live—and eat (Bureau of Labor Statistics).</p>

            <h3>Few New Chefs in Sight</h3>
            <p>While frontline jobs exploded, the chef segment remained surprisingly flat. The BLS projects that employment for chefs and head cooks will grow just <strong>8% from 2022 to 2032</strong>—in line with the national average, rather than a culinary surge.</p>
            <p>This flat trend, visible in our yellow line across multiple states, highlights that the fast-food industry's growth focuses heavily on efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness, not gourmet skills or culinary innovation.</p>

            <h3>Resilient Through Economic Storms</h3>
            <p>Fast-food jobs have proved remarkably durable in economic downturns. During the 2008–2009 recession, affordable meals became more popular, helping the fast-food sector recover faster than many others.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic was even more telling: by the end of 2023, fast-food employment had exceeded its pre-pandemic peak, adding around <strong>300,000 jobs in one year</strong> (National Restaurant Association). These robust recoveries demonstrate that, in uncertain times, quick, affordable food remains a staple for American consumers.</p>

            <h3>Rising Wages, Rising Robots</h3>
            <p>Recent changes in policies and wages are reshaping the fast-food landscape. For instance, California recently raised its minimum wage for fast-food workers to <strong>$20/hour</strong>, yet employment still hit record highs—around <strong>750,000 workers</strong> (Brookings Institution).</p>
            <p>But higher wages also accelerate automation. Restaurants increasingly invest in self-service kiosks and even robots to handle routine tasks. As Brookings Institution researchers explain, when labor costs rise, automation becomes more appealing economically. Will future fast-food jobs involve fewer humans and more machines?</p>

            <h3>The Future: Worker Rights and Public Opinion</h3>
            <p>Looking forward, employment trends won't be decided by economics alone. Public opinion and worker rights matter too. A 2018 <strong>Pew Research Center</strong> survey found <strong>62% of Americans</strong> support fast-food workers' right to unionize and push for better conditions.</p>
            <p>As sentiment shifts, restaurants face new pressures not just to automate, but also to invest in their human workforce. Whether fast-food employment continues expanding, evolves, or stabilizes depends heavily on how these social, political, and economic trends intersect in coming years.</p>

            <h3>Fast Food's Rising Role in Nutrition</h3>
            <p>Fast-food outlets have become ubiquitous, shaping diets and economies. We know that fast-food has gone from a niche indulgence to a major part of the food supply. Despite concerns over junk food, fast-food can supply key nutrients.</p>
            <p>For instance, National Library of Medicine says a healthier "kids' meals" that included fruit and milk (meeting federal school-lunch standards) contained twice the iron and three times the vitamin A of typical fast-food combos.</p>
            <p>In other words, choice of menu matters: fast-food can provide protein, vitamins and minerals when balanced with fruits, vegetables or milk. That said, diets high in fast foods tend to be higher in calories, fat and added sugar and lower in fiber. In sum, fast food now contributes a large slice of people's diets, for better or worse.</p>
            <p>Hover over any nutrient bar to see its detailed contribution from fast food sources over time, and use the year slider to track changes in consumption patterns across decades.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step" data-step="1">
          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
            <p>Fast-food's share of carbohydrate intake has roughly doubled since the late 1970s. In 1977–78, Americans consumed about 35 g of carbs per day from fast-food sources. By the 2010s this had climbed to over 70 g.</p>
            <p>The increase was steady through the 1980s and 1990s, peaking around 2011–12. This means fast food now supplies nearly one-third of all carbohydrate Americans eat.</p>
            <p>In practical terms, as dining out grew, Americans have been getting more of their starches and sugars from restaurants and takeaways – roughly doubling the 1970s level of fast-food carbs.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="step" data-step="2">
          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Energy (Calories)</h3>
            <p>Total daily caloric intake per person rose about 15% from 1977 to 2017. Fast-food calories rose even faster, from roughly 17.6% in 1977 to about 33% by 2017. In other words, the fast-food portion of Americans' diets doubled over four decades.</p>
            <p>USDA highlights that fast-food's energy share "rose from 5.9 to 16.3 percent" between 1977 and 2018, a trend our data echo and even amplify. In practice, fast food now provides roughly one out of every three calories consumed by the U.S. population.</p>
            <p>This aligns with findings that modern fast-food meals can be calorie-dense – for example, a large burger-and-fries combo can supply 60–80% of the daily saturated-fat or calorie limit in a single sitting according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

        <div class="step" data-step="3">
          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Dietary Fiber</h3>
            <p>Fast-food's fiber share climbed from 16.6% in 1977–78 to about 30.7% today. That means nearly one-third of daily fiber—from bread, fries, salads, etc., now comes from away-from-home meals.</p>
            <p>Yet overall fiber intake remains over 20% below USDA recommendations, so despite fast-food's growing contribution, fiber consumption is still a major public-health shortfall.</p>

          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Iron</h3>
            <p>Fast food's iron share shot up from 16% in 1977 to over 30% by 2017—even as total iron intake dipped. Burgers and fortified buns power that rise, but the average U.S. diet still runs about 20% below iron needs (USDA).</p>
            <p>Healthier fast food meals like kids' meals built to school lunch standards deliver twice the iron of typical combos.</p>

          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Protein</h3>
            <p>Today, fast food supplies about one-third of Americans' daily protein intake, up from just 17% in the late 70s. That growth aligns with USDA findings that most Americans hit their protein targets.</p>
            <p>Burgers, chicken sandwiches, even dairy-based items all deliver protein, though often with a side of extra fat. So while the source has shifted from home-cooked to drive-thru, the intake is strong.</p>

          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Total Fat</h3>
            <p>Fast-food's fat share has doubled from about 18% in 1977 to 34% by 2017, peaking around 2011. A single combo can pack 60–80% of your daily saturated-fat limit, and studies show kids who eat fast food routinely load up on more total and saturated fat than peers.</p>
            <p>Smart swaps like grilled proteins, lighter sides, no creamy sauces can cut that burden significantly.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Daily Nutrient Needs</h3>
            <p>Everyone's body needs a mix of calories and nutrients (protein, carbs, fiber, iron, etc.) each day to stay healthy. These needs change with age and sex. For example, the UK NHS notes an average man requires about 2,500 kcal/day versus 2,000 kcal for an average woman. In practical terms this means men – with larger muscle mass – typically need more protein and energy.</p>
            <p>There is no one‐size‐fits‐all diet – guidelines show target intakes for each life stage (see USDA/NIH Dietary Reference Intakes) so we meet nutritional needs across the lifespan.</p>
            <p>Interact with the visualization by hovering over any nutrient spike to see exact recommended values. Use the age range dropdown to explore how nutritional needs evolve through life stages, and toggle between male and female to see gender-specific recommendations. Watch how the bowl filling and nutrient spikes adjust as you change these settings.</p>

          <div class="step-content">
            <h3>Filling the Nutrient Bowl Across Life Stages</h3>
            <p>Think of your daily nutrition needs as a bowl. Calories fill it up, while nutrients like protein, fiber, and iron are drawn out like colorful lollies. But not everyone's bowl is the same.</p>
            <p><strong>Men vs. Women:</strong> Men usually need more calories and protein to support muscle mass—around 2,400–2,800 kcal and 56g of protein per day, compared to 1,800–2,200 kcal and 46g for women (NHS).</p>
            <p><strong>Growing Girls:</strong> Teen girls (14–18) have higher iron needs—about 15mg daily—due to menstruation. Boys of the same age need less, roughly 11mg (NIH).</p>
            <p><strong>Older Adults:</strong> With age, the bowl shrinks—calorie needs drop (around 1,600–2,200 kcal), but the importance of nutrients like fiber goes up. Men 51+ should aim for ~30g of fiber, women ~21g, to aid digestion and prevent chronic disease (PMC).</p>
            <p>Across ages, gender, and life stages, the goal stays the same: fill the bowl with energy, but make sure the nutrients you pull out match your body's needs.</p>

        <div class="step" data-step="2">

            <h3>Fast Food and Balanced Nutrition</h3>
            <p>Fast food has a bad rep, and sometimes, rightly so. A typical fast-food combo (burger, fries, soda) can pile on ~1,200 kcal, 14g of saturated fat, and 2,100mg sodium, twice what most people should have in one meal (Harvard Health).</p>
            <p>But with a few mindful swaps, grilled options, smaller portions, ditching sugary drinks—you can cut that down to 750 kcal and still get key nutrients. Most restaurants now show nutrition info, so you can build smarter meals that support your day's goals.</p>
            <p>A study of fast-food kids' meals found that those designed to meet school lunch standards (including fruit and milk) delivered double the iron and triple the vitamin A compared to typical choices (American Journal of Clinical Nutrition). It's proof that when fast food is chosen wisely, it can do more than just satisfy a craving.</p>
            <h4>Balanced Diet Takeaways</h4>
            <p>Fast food isn't the villain, it's the context that matters. If your fast-food pick contributes positively say, a wrap with greens and water instead of soda it can fit just fine.</p>
            <p>So go ahead, enjoy your favorite meal just fill your bowl mindfully. Make sure you're hitting the right mix of calories and nutrients across the day, not just in one sitting. Fast food can be part of a healthy life when it's balanced with smarter choices.</p>
