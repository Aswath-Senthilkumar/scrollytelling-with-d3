# What's Cooking? The Fast-Food Shift in America's Diet

An interactive, storytelling-based data visualization dashboard exploring the historical and geographic expansion of fast-food chains across the United States, their influence on American eating habits, and broader public health implications.

## Project Overview

This project combines compelling storytelling with robust data analytics to engage users in understanding the evolution of America's fast-food landscape. Using a scroll-based narrative format, we guide viewers through multiple interactive visualizations that reveal patterns in fast-food consumption, geographic distribution, and changes over time.

Key aspects explored include:

- Geographic distribution of fast-food chains across different states
- Historical expansion patterns of major chains from 1990 to present
- Relative dominance of chains based on revenue and number of locations
- Regional preferences and popular chains by state
- Nutritional content analysis of popular menu items
- The rise of food delivery services and their impact

## Structure

The project is built as an immersive scrollytelling experience with multiple synchronized visualizations that reveal themselves as the user progresses through the narrative:

1. **Fast Food Density Map (Choropleth)** - Interactive time-series visualization showing the density of fast food restaurants across US counties from 1990 to present, with animation controls.

2. **Statewise Popularity Map (Hexagonal Grid)** - Shows the most searched and popular fast food chains by state in a visually engaging hexagonal layout.

3. **Delivery-App Drill-Down (Zoomable Sunburst)** - Visualizes the growth of food delivery apps over time with user ratings and market share.

4. **Revenue and Location Comparison** - Compares the top fast food chains by revenue and number of locations.

5. **Nutritional Content Analysis** - Visualizes the nutritional content of popular menu items across different chains.

6. **Interactive Bowl Builder** - Allows users to construct virtual meals and see nutritional impact with animated nutrient spikes.

7. **Regional Preference Map** - Shows geographic preferences for different types of fast food.

8. **Historical Timeline** - Tracks the expansion of major chains over decades.

9. **Supply Chain Visualization** - Maps the complex supply chains behind fast food production.

10. **Health Impact Dashboard** - Correlates fast food density with public health metrics.

## Interactive Features

The visualization incorporates numerous interactive elements to enhance user engagement:

- **Time Controls** - Slider and play/pause/replay buttons for time-based animations
- **Tooltips** - Detailed information on hover for all data points
- **Zooming and Panning** - Drill down into specific geographic regions
- **Filtering Controls** - Isolate specific chains or time periods
- **Modal Windows** - Detailed information and micro-visualizations
- **Animated Transitions** - Smooth state changes between visualization updates

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js** - For data visualization and interactive graphics
- **Scrollama** - For scroll-based interactions and triggers
- **SVG** - For vector graphics and animations
- **CSS3** - For styling and transitions
- **HTML5** - For structure and semantics
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - For functionality and interactivity

## Visual Design

The project employs a cohesive visual language with:

- A consistent color palette focusing on red tones that complement the fast food theme
- Clear visual hierarchy and typography for optimal readability
- Progressive color scales for data representation
- Responsive design that works across different device sizes
- Thoughtful use of animation to highlight key insights
